At the same time, please be aware that this mobile application is only able to receive Remote ID via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi from drones that are equipped with this Remote ID function. iOS devices have system limitations for the Wi-Fi, so if you are using iOS, you won't be able to receive data transmitted by Wi-Fi.\"}],\"halfWidthQuestions\":\"\"},\"find_more_information\":{\"title\":\"Find More Information\",\"text\":\"<strong>US</strong>:<br/><a target='_blank' href='https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id'>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website</a> provides a comprehensive overview of Remote ID.

Additionally, you can find information on the European Commission's official website, where the draft of the regulation is being discussed.\",\"fullWidthQuestions\":[{\"title\":\"Tech specifications for Remote ID range\",\"id\":\"tech_specifications_for_remote_id_range\",\"answer\":\"Broadcasting Direct Remote ID data through one of the mandatory technologies (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) is sufficient to comply with the regulations, even though both channels can be combined. Regarding general ranges, Wi-Fi offers a greater range, thanks to 10 times higher transmission power than Bluetooth (100mW vs. 10mW). The Wi-Fi Remote ID transmission can reach kilometers, but it also comes with some downsides; for example, Wi-Fi add-on modules are known for common issues with the interference of drones' internal hardware, which can use the same frequency channel<br/><br/>Bluetooth technology used in Direct / Broadcast Remote ID is different than the one we all know from smartphones, headphones and speakers. Remote ID devices are equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which provides one-way communication only through broadcasting from the aircraft. Due to that, Bluetooth BLE is capable of transmitting a signal over a much greater distance than Standard Bluetooth, which reaches hundreds of meters range. Bluetooth BLE can reach up to 3 km (1.86 miles) in unobstructed outdoor conditions, as confirmed by multiple field tests.\"},{\"title\":\"What are ASTM and ASD-STAN Remote ID standards?\",\"id\":\"astm_and_asd_stan\",\"answer\":\"Regulated operation of drones in US and EU regions are defined by technical standards issued by ASTM and ASD-STAN.<br/><br/>International organizations ASTM and ASD-STAN develop and publish technical standards for a wide range of materials, products, systems, and services, always based on public consensus.<br/>You can find more about these standards here:<br/><br/>Learn more about the American <a target='_blank' href='https://www.astm.org/f3411-22a.html'>ASTM F3411-22a</a>.<br/><br/>Learn more about the European <a target='_blank' href='https://asd-stan.org/downloads/asd-stan-pren-4709-002-p1/'>ASD-STAN prEN 4709-002</a>.\"}],\"halfWidthQuestions\":\"\"},\"about_this_website\":{\"title\":\"关于我们\",\"text\":\"感谢您访问我们的网站。本网站的主要目标是成为您在无人机远程识别技术和安全无人机操作方面的首选信息来源。我们致力于为专业无人机飞行员、无人机操作者、无人机所有者、无人机爱好者以及所有对无人机安全和负责任的空中使用感兴趣的人提供全面的知识库。我们致力于促进安全和道德的无人机使用，确保我们的访问者可以获取最新的信息和法规。我们希望您会发现我们的网站信息丰富且实用。如果您在本站发现任何错误或遗漏，请通过 <a href='mailto:info@ets-certs.com'>info@ets-certs.com</a> 联系我们，以便我们进行纠正。<br/><br/>请注意，尽管我们致力于提供有关远程识别规则的有用信息，但我们无法提供指导或建议。有关更多信息，请联系您当地的航空管理机构。<br/><br/>祝安全飞行！\"}},\"competitorsTableFields\":[{\"name\":\"Name\",\"sort_by\":\"name\",\"default_sort\":\"asc\",\"sort_type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"Network Remote ID\",\"sort_by\":\"network_remote_id_score\",\"default_sort\":\"desc\",\"sort_type\":\"number\"},{\"name\":\"Direct/Broadcast Remote ID\",\"sort_by\":\"direct_remote_id_score\",\"default_sort\":\"desc\",\"sort_type\":\"number\"},{\"name\":\"Positioning\",\"sort_by\":\"positioning_score\",\"default_sort\":\"desc\",\"sort_type\":\"number\"},{\"name\":\"Pressure Sensor\",\"sort_by\":\"pressure_sensor\",\"default_sort\":\"desc\",\"sort_type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"Average Battery Life\",\"sort_by\":\"average_battery_life\",\"default_sort\":\"desc\",\"sort_type\":\"number\"},{\"name\":\"Weight\",\"sort_by\":\"weight\",\"default_sort\":\"asc\",\"sort_type\":\"number\"},{\"name\":\"Dimensions\",\"sort_by\":\"dimensions\",\"default_sort\":\"asc\",\"sort_type\":\"dimensions\"},{\"name\":\"Price\",\"sort_by\":\"price\",\"default_sort\":\"asc\",\"sort_type\":\"number\"},{\"name\":\"Suitable for EU Direct Remote ID\",\"sort_by\":\"eu_compliant\",\"default_sort\":\"desc\",\"sort_type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"Suitable for USA Broadcast Remote ID\",\"sort_by\":\"us_compliant\",\"default_sort\":\"desc\",\"sort_type\":\"boolean\"}],\"tableDisclaimer\":\"Disclaimer: The prices and other pieces of information listed on this website are for informational purposes only and may not be accurate or up-to-date.
