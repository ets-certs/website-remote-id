At the same time, please be aware that this mobile application is only able to receive Remote ID via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi from drones that are equipped with this Remote ID function. iOS devices have system limitations for the Wi-Fi, so if you are using iOS, you won't be able to receive data transmitted by Wi-Fi.\"}],\"halfWidthQuestions\":\"\"},\"find_more_information\":{\"title\":\"Find More Information\",\"text\":\"<strong>US</strong>:<br/><a target='_blank' href='https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id'>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website</a> provides a comprehensive overview of Remote ID.

Regarding general ranges, Wi-Fi offers a greater range, thanks to 10 times higher transmission power than Bluetooth (100mW vs. 10mW). The Wi-Fi Remote ID transmission can reach kilometers, but it also comes with some downsides; for example, Wi-Fi add-on modules are known for common issues with the interference of drones' internal hardware, which can use the same frequency channel<br/><br/>Bluetooth technology used in Direct / Broadcast Remote ID is different than the one we all know from smartphones, headphones and speakers. Remote ID devices are equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which provides one-way communication only through broadcasting from the aircraft. Due to that, Bluetooth BLE is capable of transmitting a signal over a much greater distance than Standard Bluetooth, which reaches hundreds of meters range. Bluetooth BLE can reach up to 3 km (1.86 miles) in unobstructed outdoor conditions, as confirmed by multiple field tests.\"},{\"title\":\"What are ASTM and ASD-STAN Remote ID standards?\",\"id\":\"astm_and_asd_stan\",\"answer\":\"Regulated operation of drones in US and EU regions are defined by technical standards issued by ASTM and ASD-STAN.<br/><br/>International organizations ASTM and ASD-STAN develop and publish technical standards for a wide range of materials, products, systems, and services, always based on public consensus.<br/>You can find more about these standards here:<br/><br/>Learn more about the American <a target='_blank' href='https://www.astm.org/f3411-22a.html'>ASTM F3411-22a</a>.<br/><br/>Learn more about the European <a target='_blank' href='https://asd-stan.org/downloads/asd-stan-pren-4709-002-p1/'>ASD-STAN prEN 4709-002</a>.\"}],\"halfWidthQuestions\":\"\"},\"about_this_website\":{\"title\":\"About this website\",\"text\":\"Thank you for visiting our website.
